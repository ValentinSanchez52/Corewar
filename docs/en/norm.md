# Norm to follow:

 - ## Base  
	Is the [42 norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/1608/norme.en.pdf).
 - ## Function prototypes  
	should be written this way:  
```c
type	name(
		type arg1,
		type arg2,
		type arg3
);
```  
	The only exception to this is when you have one argument you can write it inline.

 - ## Files
	Each file should only contain one function named as the file.  
	You can make `static` functions as well as long as there it respects the 42 norm.

 - ## Flags
